## Recommendation

Anthony is first and foremost a great person with an immeasurable amount of care for the people he manages. Armed with a huge arsenal of experience in technology he offers lessons and literature recommendations that were not only enlightening but also practical. I felt that he care a lot about my growth as a person & developer and is always around when I needed to talk to him. I think it is Anthony's nature is to be a multiplier of not only productivity but also happiness for his team.

## What is your most memorable accomplishment together

I felt that the greatest accomplishment that I've had with Anthony was improving my communication skills. Previously, I had some issues communicating and navigating through technology disagreements with my team. I aimed to institute some changes that I thought would help the team but were not being well received. In a 1:1 with Anthony, he coached me on some communication techniques and loaned me a book that helped me greatly. In weeks to follow, I felt better introducing new concepts to my team and had greater success! 

## Biggest Strengths

Anthony is an amazing manager. His biggest strength is in his nature to care for people. He is driven to help his employees grow as individuals & as a team.

## Biggest Weaknesses

Anthony is eager to help in many facets of the company but I believe he can overextend himself sometimes. I believe he may thrive more given the opportunity to focus a little closer within the technology sector of the company. 

## What type of work environment do you think Anthony will most likely thrive in?

I think Anthony thrives in a position where he can provide technical guidance and manage teams.

## Would you work with/for Anthony again?

Yes! I owe alot of my growth to him as a individual & software developer.
